/**
A list of installation directives for the mod.

This is equivalent to the **install** [attribute][0] in a .ckan file.

If no installation directives are provided, neuCKAN must find the top-most directory in the archive that matches the module identifier, which it shall install with `GameData/` as the target.

A typical set of installation directives only has **file** and **install_to** attributes in a .ckan file:

```
"install" : [
	{
		"file"       : "GameData/ExampleMod",
		"install_to" : "GameData"
	}
]
```

	Subfolder paths under a matched directory will be preserved, but directories will only be created when installing to `GameData/`, `Tutorial/`, or `Scenarios/`.
